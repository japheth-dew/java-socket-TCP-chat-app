# java-socket-TCP-chat-app

üòÅWelcome back!

So last time on my repo... i deploy a similar App with python and my God... life was easy with python 
yeah... i decided to write a more complex one with Java today... and as usual it was bulky
so this is an improvement to the python App i deployed yesterday
<b/> ** UPDATES ** 

<ul>
<li>Handles more than one client</li>
<li> Uses Threading </li>
<li> usernames can be changed at will </li>
<li> server can be quited with a "/quit" cmd </li>

</ul>

Now thats my part of the story....

lets see what Javatpoint has to say: 


<b>Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE. </b>

Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.

Socket and ServerSocket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and DatagramSocket and 
DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.

The client in socket programming must know two information:

<ul>
<li>IP Address of Server, and </li>
<li> Port number. </li>
</ul>
